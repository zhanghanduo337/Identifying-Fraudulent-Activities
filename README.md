# Identifying-Fraudulent-Activities
Build a model to predict whether an activity is fraudulent and analyze performance via ROC/PR curve

# Project 3: Identifying Fraudulent Activities

## Challenge Description
Company XYZ is an e-commerce site that sells hand-made clothes.
You have to build a model that predicts whether a user has a high probability of using the site to perform some illegal activity or not. 
You only have information about the user first transaction on the site and based on that you have to make your classification ("fraud/no fraud").
These are the tasks you are asked to do:
1. For each user, determine her country based on the numeric IP address.
2. Build a model to predict whether an activity is fraudulent or not. Explain how different assumptions about the cost of false positives vs false negatives would impact the model.
4. Let's say you now have this model which can be used live to predict in real time if an activity is fraudulent or not. From a product perspective, how would you use it? That is, what kind of different user experiences would you build based on the model output?
